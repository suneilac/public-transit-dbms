		Final Project - P2 Schemas

Following the ER diagram, the following schemas would be implemented into the project:

1) start(station_id, stop_id, walking_dist)
2) dest(station_id, stop_id, walking_dist)

# Train stations
3) stations(station_id, name)
4) train_schedule(train_id, station_id, day, time, direction)
5) trains(train_id, name, direction)

# Bus stops
6) bus_stops(stop_id, name)
7) bus_schedule(bus_id, stop_id, day, time, direction)
8) buses(train_id, name, direction)

# Directions
9) train_to_bus(station_id, stop_id, walking_dist)
10) train_to_train(station1_id, station2_id, walking_dist)
11) bus_to_bus(stop1_id, stop2_id, walking_dist)
