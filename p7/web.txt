Instructions for running:

In terminal run:

  $ python3 suneila.py 

This should open http://localhost:8080/ automatically. If it doesn't do that, then go to the previously mentioned URL.

One of the functionalities implemented was a user page. For example, going to http://localhost:8080/user/suneil should
display a different result from http://localhost:8080/user/<your_name>
